# rename-text-layers-by-style

## Installation

- Install the plugin from Sketchpacks or Runner Pro

## How to Use it

Either select all the text layers you want to rename to their text style or simply rename all text layers in your Sketch document.

## Why?

This plugin keeps your text layers properly named for development hand-over and avoids the messy renaming that Sketch applies when you copy text layers.
